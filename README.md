# Discord-Dark-Vaporwave-Retro
A dark Vaporwave Theme for the discord client written in CSS
In my case the theme is used in Firefox with an addon called Stylus.

~~**This tutorial is telling you how to manually install the theme in your browser!

**Step 1: Getting stylus

Stylus can be gotten here:

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne

Opera: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/

**Step 1.5: Getting the theme from Userstyles

If you want to skip ahead and get the style from userstyles.com, open this page this theme may be an outdated version, but I want to make sure to keep it updated.

If you want to install it manually, ignore this and go ahead with step 2

**Step 2: Opening discord.com/app

After you installed the addon, go to the official discord website https://discord.com/app

**Step 3: Opening the addon and the theme creator

Once you went onto https://discord.com/app, you need to open Stylus by clicking onto the extensions button, which will differ from browser to browser.

Once you opened it it will tell you that no styles are installed for the site, you then need to click "discord.com"

You will find yourself in a window looking like this:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64021242/232129691-e0ae0ba5-945b-4148-8dec-dfba9d4482ae.png)

Now you head to the files above or to the releases and open the css.txt, copy all the text that is in there into your clipboard, and paste it into that webpage.

In the upper left it will say "discord.com" in a text field, that is how your theme will be saved, you may write a name you want it to be saved as there.

I named mine Discord Dark Vaporwave Retro

After pasting the theme code and writing a name into the text field in the upper left, you need to save the theme, using the button below the text field in the upper left.

If you want to enable the theme already, make sure the box that is saying activated, is ticked already

Now if you want to disable the theme, you can easily repeat Step 2, this time it will show you a ticked box next to the name of the theme or an unticked box next to the theme name if you chose to disable the theme

To enable it, just tick the box, to disable it, untick the box, that's it!
If it works you're done!

**Step 4: Enjoy the theme and report problems if you find any ^^
